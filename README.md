## What is RoboRumble?

Welcome to RoboRumble, where education meets entertainment in an immersive coding adventure! Our game is designed to introduce teens to the exciting world of programming through engaging robot clashes and strategic puzzles. RoboRumble isn't just a game; it's a gateway to understanding programming principles in a fun and interactive way. Players dive into a grid-based map, where they must program their robot's behavior to overcome challenges of increasing difficulty. As they progress, they'll face more complex enemy robots, requiring coding techniques for victory. What sets RoboRumble apart is its mission: to demystify programming and make it accessible to all. By merging education with entertainment, we aim to break stereotypes and inspire the next generation of coders.

## Who are we?

We are a dedicated team of five passionate Computer Science students from Bilkent University. Each of us brings a unique set of skills to the table, ranging from coding expertise to design flair and project management proficiency.
